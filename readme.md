# Changes Made

1. I update the styling to reflect my portfolio site. For this I use tachyons.io for easier responsive design.

2. Screen media query is now checked. Smaller screens (mobile) get a screen wide view. Large screens are split two thirds for quiz contents and one third for results for easier reading and less scrolling.

3. Added an anchor to results tag so user doesn't have to scroll on submit.

4. 10 new quiz questions added. Results reflected to show changes.

5. Changed submit button to highlighted text. This brings the content in-line with the style. The next step would be changing mc radio options as well, but I had difficulties editing that prompt without effecting the quiz structure.

6. Turned off autocomplete on the main form so that prior answers do not appear when taking the quiz multiple times on the same device.
